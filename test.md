## 2. Detailed PRD Sections

### A. Problem Statement

- **Description:**  
  *Briefly explain the problem that the feature solves.*  
  *Example:* "The current communication method is slow, leading to delays and miscommunication. This feature aims to enable real-time interactions, improving overall user engagement and satisfaction."

---

### B. Goal

- **Description:**  
  *Define the expected functional and business outcomes upon completion of the feature.*  
  *Example:* "To deliver a robust messaging system that enhances user engagement, reduces communication delays, and supports scalability for future feature expansion."

---

### C. Key Features Breakdown

- **Must-Have Features:**  
  *List each feature and include any technical notes if necessary.*  
  *Example:*  
  1. **Real-Time Messaging:**  
     - Implement using WebSockets (e.g. Socket.IO) for instantaneous delivery.
  2. **Message Persistence:**  
     - Use a PostgreSQL database to store chat history with efficient query performance.

- **Good-to-Have Features:**  
  *Example:*  
  1. **Typing Indicators:**  
     - Visual cue when a user is typing.
  2. **Read Receipts:**  
     - Confirm message delivery and viewing status.

---

### D. User Stories

- **Structure:**  
  Format each story as: "As a [user role], I want to [action], so that I can [benefit]."

- **Examples:**  
  - "As a user, I want to receive real-time notifications when I get a new message, so that I stay updated without constant manual refresh."  
  - "As an admin, I want to view chat logs, so that I can monitor for potential misuse."

- **Hint:**  
  Cover various scenarios and user roles to ensure comprehensive coverage.

---

### E. User Flow

- **Description:**  
  *Outline the step-by-step journey a user takes while interacting with the feature.*

- **Example Flow:**  
  1. User logs into the platform.  
  2. User navigates to the messaging interface.  
  3. User selects a conversation or initiates a new chat.  
  4. User sends a message using the text input field.  
  5. The system processes and displays the message in real time.  
  6. The recipient receives a notification and views the message.

- **Hint:**  
  Use diagrams (if possible) or bullet points to visually represent the flow.

---

### F. Frontend Solution

- **UI Components:**  
  *Describe the components to be created and their behaviour.*  
  *Example:*  
  - Chat Window: Should display messages in a scrollable area.  
  - Input Field: For composing messages, with a send button.  
  - Notification Badge: To indicate new messages.

- **Hint:**  
  Consider responsiveness, accessibility, and consistency with existing design patterns.

---

### G. Backend Solution

- **Technical Details:**  
  *Outline API endpoints, database models, and expected interactions.*

- **Example:**  
  - **API Endpoints:**  
    - `POST /api/messages` – To send a new message.  
    - `GET /api/messages?conversationId=[id]` – To fetch conversation history.
  - **Database Model:**  
    - **Message Model:**  
      - Fields: `id`, `senderId`, `receiverId`, `content`, `timestamp`  
      - Relationships: Link with User and Conversation models.
  - **Integration:**  
    - Ensure the API uses authentication tokens and follows RESTful conventions.

- **Hint:**  
  Clearly define request/response formats and error handling protocols.

---

### H. Testing Overview

- **QA Guidelines:**  
  *Outline key areas and scenarios for testing the feature.*

- **Example Test Cases:**  
  - Verify that messages are delivered within 2 seconds.  
  - Check message persistence in the database.  
  - Test the UI for responsiveness across devices and browsers.  
  - Validate error handling when the API call fails.

- **Hint:**  
  Include both functional and non-functional tests such as performance and security checks.

---

### I. Development Timeline & Phases

- **Proposed Timeline:**  
  *Break down the work into phases with an estimated timeline.*

- **Example:**  
  - **Phase 1 (Days 1-2):** Set up backend APIs and database schema.  
  - **Phase 2 (Days 3-4):** Develop frontend components and integrate with backend.  
  - **Phase 3 (Day 5):** Conduct integration testing and resolve any issues.  
  - **Phase 4 (Day 6):** Optimise performance and prepare for deployment.

- **Hint:**  
  Adjust timelines based on team capacity and project complexity.
