# Learnings from Building the AI Todo List App

## 1. Date Parsing
- **Don't Trust LLM Date Parsing**: Initially relied on LLM to parse dates, but it often hallucinated dates. Switched to Python's `dateutil` library for reliable date parsing.
- **Hybrid Approach Works Best**: Using Python for date parsing and LLM for task categorization/priority combines the strengths of both.
- **Future Date Handling**: Need to handle relative dates ("tomorrow", "next week") and automatically roll dates forward if they're in the past.

## 2. LLM Integration
- **Specific Prompts**: LLM performs better with very specific output format requirements (JSON structure).
- **Temperature Matters**: Lower temperature (0.1) gives more consistent structured data output.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Better to ask LLM for specific aspects (category, priority) rather than everything at once.
- **Error Handling**: LLM calls can fail or return malformed JSON - robust error handling is essential.

## 3. UI/UX Considerations
- **Loading States**: Essential to show AI processing state to users.
- **Priority Visualization**: Color-coding tasks by priority helps quick visual scanning.
- **Fallback Behavior**: Need graceful degradation when AI features fail.

## 4. Technical Architecture
- **JSON Storage Limitations**: 
  - Simple for demo but lacks atomic operations
  - No concurrent write handling
  - No backup/recovery mechanism
  - Consider SQLite or proper DB for production
- **API Design**:
  - Separate endpoints for CRUD vs AI operations
  - Need rate limiting for LLM calls
  - Consider caching common task patterns

## 5. Missing Features from Original PRD
- Confidence indicators for AI parsing
- User correction workflow
- Alternative interpretations
- Achievement system
- Recurrence pattern detection
- Performance metrics display

## 6. Potential Improvements
1. **Storage**:
   - Implement proper database with SQLite/PostgreSQL
   - Add backup mechanism
   - Handle concurrent writes

2. **AI Features**:
   - Add confidence scores for parsed fields
   - Allow user corrections/feedback
   - Learn from user corrections
   - Add task suggestions based on patterns

3. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Add task editing
   - Show AI parsing details
   - Add task completion tracking
   - Add sorting/filtering options

4. **Performance**:
   - Add caching layer
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request timeouts
   - Monitor API response times

## 7. Security Considerations
- Need input sanitization
- API key protection
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Input validation

## 8. Demo Experience
- Need better error messages
- Add example tasks
- Show "backend thinking"
- Add usage statistics
